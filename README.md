# AgroNity – Digital Farming Platform 🌱

AgroNity is a web-based **digital farming platform** that connects farmers and customers,
helps farmers make better crop decisions using data, and provides a learning hub for
modern farming practices.

The goal is to **empower farmers** with technology instead of just building another
grocery app.
